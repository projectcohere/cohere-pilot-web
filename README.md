## Setup [↑](#table-of-contents)

If you don't use a tool to manage multiple ruby versions, please install one. We recommend [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).

Once rbenv is installed, please install the project ruby:

```sh
$ rbenv install
```

And then run the setup command.

```sh
$ make init
```

## Development [↑](#table-of-contents)

Most common commands can be run using `make`. To see a list of available commands, you
can always run:

```sh
$ make # or `make help`
```
